## Task 3

- The following snippet is from `./src/quicksort.cpp` lines 32-43. Discuss in groups how the code works:

```cpp
void quickSort(int arr[], int low, int high)
{
    if (low < high)
    {
        //partition the array
        int pivot = partition(arr, low, high);

        //sort the sub arrays independently
        quickSort(arr, low, pivot - 1);
        quickSort(arr, pivot + 1, high);
    }
}
```

- The following snippet is from `./src/quicksort.cpp` line 27. Discuss in groups how Ã¬t works:

```cpp
swap(&arr[i + 1], &arr[high]);
```

## Task 4: Individual (at home)

1. Merge-sort has better worst case performance than quicksort. So why Quick-sort is considered better than Merge-sort? Refer to the following article
   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quicksort-better-mergesort/

    Auxiliary Space : Mergesort uses extra space, quicksort requires little space and exhibits good cache locality. Quick sort is an in-place sorting algorithm. In-place sorting means no additional storage space is needed to perform sorting. Merge sort requires a temporary array to merge the sorted arrays and hence it is not in-place giving Quick sort the advantage of space.
    Worst Cases : The worst case of quicksort O(n2) can be avoided by using randomized quicksort. It can be easily avoided with high probability by choosing the right pivot. Obtaining an average case behavior by choosing right pivot element makes it improvise the performance and becoming as efficient as Merge sort.
    Locality of reference : Quicksort in particular exhibits good cache locality and this makes it faster than merge sort in many cases like in virtual memory environment.
    Merge sort is better for large data structures: Mergesort is a stable sort, unlike quicksort and heapsort, and can be easily adapted to operate on linked lists and very large lists stored on slow-to-access media such as disk storage or network attached storage.


2. Refer to the following article. Analyze the complexity of the Merge-sort algorithm.

Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that works by dividing an array into smaller subarrays, sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together to form the final sorted array.

In simple terms, we can say that the process of merge sort is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves back together. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

One thing that you might wonder is what is the specialty of this algorithm. We already have a number of sorting algorithms then why do we need this algorithm? One of the main advantages of merge sort is that it has a time complexity of O(n log n), which means it can sort large arrays relatively quickly. It is also a stable sort, which means that the order of elements with equal values is preserved during the sort.

Merge sort is a popular choice for sorting large datasets because it is relatively efficient and easy to implement. It is often used in conjunction with other algorithms, such as quicksort, to improve the overall performance of a sorting routine.

3. Refer to the following article. Analyze the complexity of the Quick-sort algorithm.

   https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/quick-sort/
Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. 

    Always pick the first element as a pivot.
    Always pick the last element as a pivot (implemented below)
    Pick a random element as a pivot.
    Pick median as the pivot.

The key process in quickSort is a partition(). The target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of an array as the pivot, put x at its correct position in a sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.
